# InitPHP

This tutorial is aimed at PHP beginners. It will take you through setting up a 
PHP environment and structuring your code. It's assumed you already know 
programming basics such as `if` statements and `for` loops. 

We're going to be setting up a virtual machine to run our php webite, and then 
we can work through all the challenges. For each challenge be sure to create a
separate git branch to keep all your work separate. Once you've completed a 
challenge, submit a pull request from you new branch into your master branch,
then you can get someone to easily review your code.
